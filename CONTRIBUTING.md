# Contributing

Please feel free to send pull requests containing new annotations. If
a new annotation might be tricky or controversial, consider opening
the pull request early, before devoting too much time to it. Or maybe
make an issue instead.

## Building

The `build.ps1` script at the top of the module builds the annotations
package, putting it in `artifacts/packages`.
